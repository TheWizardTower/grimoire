... but a null ain't one.

This is my attempt to teach myself both Haskell and the surrounding toolchain. The eventual goal is to have a fully-tested thing I could theoretically submit to Hackage.

* TODO
** Finish the project.
Namely, write solutions to all the problems in the set.
** Test your solutions.
Prove they work! And learn Haskell Testing in the process.
** Document your solutions.
Haddock looks cool. Learn how to use it.
** Make more awful jokes.
I'm sure this will happen without much added effort.

* Feedback?
Always appreciated. Send along if you think I've done something either awesome or horrifying.
